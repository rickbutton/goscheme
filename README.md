goscheme
========

A Go Scheme interpreter

Pretty obvious what it does. Not a lot of the std library is implemented yet. There is enough to write a REPL in scheme.

    ./goscheme repl.scm

Fully custom, hand-written lexer and parser.

Future Features

- Goroutine integration
- Full R6RS standard compatability
